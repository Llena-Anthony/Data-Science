#  Prelim Activity 02 – Agriculture Data Analysis

##  Overview
This project is part of the **Data Science / Statistics Prelim Laboratory Activities**.  
The objective of **Prelim Activity 02** is to analyze an agriculture dataset using **descriptive statistics** and **data visualization** techniques, implemented in both **Excel** and **Python**.

The activity focuses on understanding data distribution, central tendencies, variability, and graphical interpretation.

---

##  Objectives
The activity aims to:
- Compute measures of **central location**
- Compute measures of **position / location**
- Compute measures of **variability**
- Visualize the data using **histograms** and **boxplots**
- Interpret numerical and graphical results clearly and professionally

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains agricultural variables related to farm production and inputs, including:
- **Livestock Production (Heads per Year)**
- **Annual Rainfall (Millimeter)**
- **Fertilizer Use (kg per hectare)**
- **Crop Price (USD per Ton)**

---

##  Statistical Measures Computed

### **A. Measures of Central Location**
- Mean  
- Median  
- Mode  

### **B. Measures of Position / Location**
- First Quartile (Q1)  
- Third Quartile (Q3)  
- 5th Percentile  
- 95th Percentile  

### **C. Measures of Variability**
- Variance  
- Standard Deviation

##  Data Visualization
For each variable, the following visualizations were created:
- **Histograms** – to observe frequency distribution and data spread  
- **Boxplots** – to summarize median, quartiles, range, and detect outliers  

Visualizations were implemented in:
- **Google Sheets**
- **Python (Matplotlib)**

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets**

## 📝 Key Findings (Summary)
- No mode was observed across all variables, indicating no repeated values.
- Most variables showed **moderate variability**, as reflected by their standard deviations.
- Histograms revealed generally balanced distributions without extreme skewness.
- Boxplots showed **no significant outliers**, suggesting consistent agricultural patterns across farms.

##  Conclusion
This activity demonstrates the effective use of descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to analyze agricultural data. By combining numerical measures and graphical representations, meaningful insights were derived regarding production levels, environmental conditions, and economic factors.
