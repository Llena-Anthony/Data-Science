# Prelim Activity 1: Descriptive Statistics
## Objectives:
- to determine the different types of measures from a data set in order to provide basic statistical information
- to apply basic descriptive statistics
- to make the appropriate data representation in tabular and graphical form

## Tools
- Dataset with sufficient quantitative and qualitative data
- Python
- Excel or Google Sheets

## Requirements
1. Dataset
- A dataset containing different types of data (numeric and text)
2. Descriptive Statistics using Excel or Google Sheets
  The following measures were computed:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
    - Midrange
    - Variance
    - Standard Deviation
  Appropriate data visualiuzations were created and properly labeled, with annotations provided where necessesary.e
3. Descriptive Statistics using Python
Python was used to perform the same dedscriptive statistical analysis, including
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
    - Midrange
    - Variance
    - Standard Deviation
Python libraries used:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib

### Data Visualization
The following graphical representations were created:
- Historgram
- Bar chart
- Box plot
Each visualizations include appropriate labels and titles to clearly represent the data.
### Files Included
- data/ raw dataset used for the analysis
- notebooks/ - Python(Colab) notebooks
- outputs/ - graphs, tables, and exported results
- reports/ - summary or interpretation
### Notes
This activity demonstrates the application of basic descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques using both spreadsheet tools and Python programming.
